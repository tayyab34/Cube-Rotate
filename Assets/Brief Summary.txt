                                            Cube Rotation and Size Changing

 It includes rotation of cube using arrow keys and size increase on pressing spacebar and reduces on releasing.

 Steps:

 1) Rotation of cube using transform.rotate
 2) Increase size by changing scale parameters
 3) Reduce size by reducing scale parameters on releasing spacebar

 I struggled in reducing size at certain limit.
 I enjoyed it because it needs some logic.
